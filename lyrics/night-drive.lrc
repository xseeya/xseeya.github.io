[00:00.00]
[00:08.30]City lights are glowing bright
[00:12.60]Driving through the endless night
[00:17.00]Neon signs and empty streets
[00:21.40]Electric pulse and synth wave beats
[00:26.00]
[00:26.40]Radio plays our favorite song
[00:30.80]Highway stretches far and long
[00:35.20]Windows down, the air is cold
[00:39.60]Stories waiting to be told
[00:44.00]
[00:44.40]Chorus:
[00:46.00]Night drive under starlit skies
[00:50.40]Watch the world pass by our eyes
[00:54.80]No destination, just the road
[00:59.20]Freedom in this moment's code
[01:04.00]
[01:08.30]Bridges crossed and tunnels passed
[01:12.60]Making memories that will last
[01:17.00]Reflections in the rearview shine
[01:21.40]This perfect moment, yours and mine
[01:26.00]
[01:26.40]Chorus:
[01:28.00]Night drive under starlit skies
[01:32.40]Watch the world pass by our eyes
[01:36.80]No destination, just the road
[01:41.20]Freedom in this moment's code
