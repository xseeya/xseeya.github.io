[00:00.00]
[00:10.20]Sunrise through my window pane
[00:14.50]Another day begins again
[00:18.90]Steam rising from my favorite cup
[00:23.30]Time to wake my spirit up
[00:28.00]
[00:28.40]Jazz notes floating through the air
[00:32.80]Morning light without a care
[00:37.20]Simple pleasures, slow and sweet
[00:41.60]Finding rhythm in the beat
[00:46.00]
[00:46.40]Chorus:
[00:48.00]Morning coffee, take your time
[00:52.40]Let the world wait, that's just fine
[00:56.80]In this moment, I am free
[01:01.20]Just my coffee and me
[01:06.00]
[01:10.20]Pages turn, the stories flow
[01:14.50]Nowhere I need to go
[01:18.90]Savoring each precious sip
[01:23.30]Let the morning slowly drip
[01:28.00]
[01:28.40]Chorus:
[01:30.00]Morning coffee, take your time
[01:34.40]Let the world wait, that's just fine
[01:38.80]In this moment, I am free
[01:43.20]Just my coffee and me
